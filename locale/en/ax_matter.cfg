[technology-description]
ax-matter-lab-tech=You've stumbled across a new type of mineral, however our current Lab is unable to process it.  A new strengthened Lab is required.
ax-matter-weird-material=You notice some new strange ore that you have not seen before, it's crystal-blue and has a strange purple glow.  Some more testing is required.
ax-matter-glowing-fluids=During your adventures you stumble across a new type of fluid deposit.	Initial testing shows that it's somehow related to Matter Ore, however further testing is required to figure out its exact properties.
ax-matter-chemical-testing=You notice a strange bonding within the test tube as you mix Solid Matter Fuel with Matter Plates, you also notice how some of the liquid is seperating pulsing with energy as it does so.
ax-matter-military-science-pack=After unloading a bullet from your piercing rounds magazine, you drop it onto the floor into a small puddle of Liquid Matter, the bullet shines bright blue and pulses with energy.  You know that this bullet is more powerful as it starts to emit intense heat in your hand, you can no longer hold it and place it ontop of some nearby Matter Plate.
ax-matter-weaponry=After burning your hand while holding a bullet that was dropped in Liquid Matter you realise that a better solution is required.  You notice the bullet that was left on the Matter Plate is no longer emitting intense heat, removing the bullet from the plate instantly causes the casing to become extremely hot. You figure that it might be possible to create a magazine out of Matter Plate.
ax-matter-cracking=You try to put some Matter Ore into a Centrifuge, the test goes quite well however the Centrifuge inner housing becomes so brittle that it cannot be used again.  Perhaps lining the inner housing with Matter Plate will fix the problem.
ax-matter-ore-conversion=Place the Ore Converter onto a supported ore patch to convert it to Matter Infused Ore, which when mined and processed grants 3x result.
ax-matter-laser-turrets=While researching how matter plate interacts with lasers, you realise that when a laser is bounced off a matter plate the laser shines a bright blue and travels further, you should be able to modify the Laser Turret to match this.
ax-matter-walls=During your research with Liquid Matter, you find that splashing Liquid Matter onto stone made it extremely tough.  You figure out a way to create Matter Infused Walls to better protect your base.
ax-matter-power-generation=Power Generation based off Liquid Matter and Water
ax-matter-oil-processing=Mixing Liquid Matter with Cruide Oil seems to lesson the waste on Cracking, it also enriches the oil to produce slightly more Light, Heavy and Petroleum
