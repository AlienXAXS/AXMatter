* Pull down the amount of time it takes to smelt a matter iron plate.
* * Check all smelting times for the above

* Reduce the amount of matter ore requried from 6 -> 2 to make the matter plate

* Slightly increase the amount of oil products you get from liquid matter oil processing.

* Add more stuff to the Yellow Technology
* * Needs ideas though, perhaps look at existing yellow technologies and create something better.
* * * Perhaps some sort of Duplication Matter Fluid that when injected into certain mats like Green Circuits etc it will duplicate the result.
* * * The result should inherit the products difficuilty though, for example Reds should be more complex perhaps in terms of requirements than Greens.
