* Change ore into matter infused ore for a better yeild
-  Stone changes into something else maybe
-  All ores should be able to change back into their original vanilla ores
-  Ores become crushed
-  Crushed coal can become carbon, then into Carbon Fibre
-  All ores can be enriched, but crushed coal can become carbon before enrichment

* Power generation via Nuclear Reactors (but heat exchangers are actually processing liquid matter)
- Make matter infused heat exchangers and matter infused steam turbines
